# Injecting Debs

## Ways to inject Deb & Dylibs into an IPA

### E-sign (On-Device)
- When Signing -> More Settings --> `Add library` select your Deb
- Make sure to enable `Auto modify jailbreak dependencies`
- Sign and install the injected IPA

### [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/binnichtakitivsipas) (On-Device)
> `t.me/binnichtakitivsipas` by `@binnichtaktiv`

This bot can inject Satella (`iap`), iGameGod (`igg`), Flex (`AllFLEXing`) and sideload bypass (`Sideloadbypass1&2`) into iPAs. 

Just send an `.iPA` file and reply to the file with `'/inject_iap`',  '`/inject_igg`', '`/inject_flex`' or '`/inject_bypass`'.

- You can also inject several tweaks at the same time. Example: '`/inject_iap & inject_igg`'

⚠️ There is no guarantee that every app will work with iGameGod or Satella!! ⚠️
